# Agile
- BRIEF - You are a Product Owner for an agency and a client has asked you to create a website for them to sell musical instruments to the public. You’ve had a meeting with them to gather the requirements. First create user stories from the requirements and fit them under one of the three
categories (Database, Back-end, Front-end). This will form your Product backlog. So you don’t overwork your team there is a point system for how much work each User Story is. For each user story that falls under Database gets 5 points, Back-end gets 4 points and Front-end gets 3 points.
For your team to make a start on the development you need to put the User Stories in each Sprint. You have 4 Sprints and can only add up to 9 points per Sprint. At the end of the 4 Sprints should be a fully functioning website the client will be happy with.
What User Stories do you choose per Sprint and why?
Complete an Excel sheet with each User Story under each Sprint. Use a word document to write down your reasons.
 
 
Most User Stories fall into two categories so will need to be broken down. You may find you might dedicate one sprint on one User Story. There is no right or wrong way to do this the main thing is to ensure the client is satisfied – however – you also need to manage client expectations and as a Product Owner you need to do what is best for the Product.
